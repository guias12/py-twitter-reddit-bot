# py-twitter-reddit-bot

A twitter bot that posts content from [r/Blessed_images](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blessed_Images/) each 3 hours.

You can see it live [here](https://twitter.com/bot_blessimages).

I made the same bot before but using [Node.js](https://github.com/guias12/reddit-and-twitter-bot), but with Python it was easier to deploy. By the way, It's running on Heroku.
